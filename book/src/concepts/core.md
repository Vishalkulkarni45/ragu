# Core Ideas

> This section introduces the fundamental concepts underlying Ragu without heavy mathematics.

## Constraint Systems

TODO: Conceptual overview of constraint systems
- What are they?
- reducing to revdot product relation

## Polynomial Commitments

TODO: Conceptual overview
- Commitments to vectors as polynomials
- Emphasis on univariate driven, FFT-avoiding strategy
- mention Batch evaluation ?

## Split Accumulation

TODO: Conceptual overview
- The problem with full recursion
- How accumulation helps
- Deferred verification
