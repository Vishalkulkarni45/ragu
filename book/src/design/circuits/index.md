# Arithmetic Circuits

Ragu reduces arithmetic circuits into a set of constraints over a witness assignment $\v{r} \in \F^{4n}$ where $n = 2^k$ is parameterized by a positive integer $k$. As a simplification, we assume all circuits are parameterized over the same value of $k$ even though individual circuits will vary by the minimum value of $k$ necessary for their reduction.

The prover demonstrates knowledge of a witness for a given public input vector $\v{k}$ that encodes the instance of the satisfiability problem.
